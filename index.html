            <h2>Welcome to Areeb Khan's Web Page</h2>
            <p>Hello! I hope you are doing great today</p>
            <p>My name is Areeb Khan. I am currently a senior at the University of Oklahoma, pursuing a degree in Information Science and Technology with a 4.0 GPA, set to graduate in May 2025. I have a strong foundation in MySQL, R programming, and various computing and data analytics tools. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve honed my skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and adaptability, which enabled me to succeed in my studies and career. In addition to this I am looking forward to pursuing my career in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning or Data analytics, as these are the growing fields in future.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have been playing Cricket since I was 6 six years old. Cricket is my passion. I am a attacking bowler, I bowl the first and last spells in the matches and provide my team with crucial wickets. Earlier I used to only bowl and was hesitant to bat.</p>
            <p> But last season I also opened for my team in batting. I can bat as per the situation. If the game demands a slow batting I will slowly. Whereas, if the game scenario requires me to play attacking game, I will play aggressive, and will try to go for big hits.</p>
            <p>I have also been a captain of many cricket teams, I have led my school's team, zonal team and club teams, and have led teams to several wins, and won several tournaments under my captaincy.</p>
            <p>Due to my performance in the leagues, I was promoted by my coaches and given the opportunity to play with International players. Availing that opportunity, I have been selected for the under 16 national cricket team of Pakistan.</p>
            <p>However, due to the last minute injury I was not able to play for the team and I was dropped. And after that I moved back to the United States. Now I am looking forward to playing for the USA's cricket team.</p>

            <p>Cricket is a relatively new sport in the USA. However it is the second biggest sport worldwide. And it is gaining popularity in the USA, after the latest T20 world hosted in the USA. Big companies are now sponsoring cricket.</p>
            <p>USA is also planning to introduce cricket in the USA at a major level, and making new grounds, and acadamies, to promote cricket in the USA.</p>
